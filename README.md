# Hospitality BI Analysis (PostgreSQL + Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end Business Intelligence workflow
using a realistic synthetic hospitality dataset.

The goal is to analyze restaurant performance from multiple perspectives:
time, staff, menu composition, and customer behavior.

## Business Questions
- How does revenue change over time?
- What are the peak hours of restaurant operations?
- Which waiters generate the highest revenue and tips?
- Which menu items contribute most to total revenue?

## Tech Stack
- PostgreSQL (SQL, joins, CTEs, window functions)
- Power BI (data modeling and dashboards)
- GitHub (project documentation)

## Dataset
Synthetic but realistic hospitality dataset (GDPR-safe).
Raw CSV files are not included in this repository.

## Project Status
SQL analysis completed. Power BI dashboards in progress.
